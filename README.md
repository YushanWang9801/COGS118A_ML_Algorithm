# An Empirical Comparision to Supervised Learning Algorithms 
## COGS 118A Final Project

## ABSTRACT

It presents a ranking of four supervised learning methods: SVMs, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, bagging classifier. The experiment uses four data sets with different magnitudes as a variety of performance criteria to evaluate the six learning methods
